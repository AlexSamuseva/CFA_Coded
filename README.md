# CFA Coded Project

This is a personal project where I code concepts I learn while preparing for my CFA exams.

The main goals are to:
- Use coding to deepen my understanding of finance concepts.
- Practice Python by applying it to real CFA topics.
- Build useful tools and visualizations for future reference.

New notebooks will be added regularly as I progress through my studies.
